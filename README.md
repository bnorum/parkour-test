# parkour-test

Parkour character controller test made as practice for my work at theCoderSchool in Syosset, NY

Very rudimentary, contains a single player script which allows for multiple jumps, and a dash controlled with mouse.

## future plans ##

-add a wall grab, climb, and ledge climb
-add mario esc triple jump
-ui
-more fun movement stuff, etc
